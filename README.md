# Dqueue-App By Team SHIELD 
Dqueue-App is a web app based on MERN stack which intends to solve the issue of longer waiting queues at the billing counters in shopping malls.

## Problem Statement:

### Slow billing process due to limited payment counters compared to customers' queue.

## Solution Proposed as:-

#### -> Customers can scan the barcode on their own and make payment
#### -> Traffic on Billing counter will be minimised.
#### -> Customers are the now "The Checkout Counters"
#### -> Based on the DIY approach
#### -> Payment gateway integrated with mobile application for seamless one-place-for-all experience.
#### -> Reducing the time consumption by ~59%
